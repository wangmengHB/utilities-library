# utilities-library

This repo is a collection of multiple utilities npm packages managed by lerna, and each of them is published independently. It mainly focus on the common used utilities, data structures and algorithms.   

Unlike other language like C++, c#, etc, there is no powerful standard fundenmental libraries for javascript. So we have to develop a lot of utilities in our serveral applications. They are repeated and duplicated, imposible for management and reusagement. 

So this repo is to collect, manage and publish common utilities / data structures / algorithms together, in order to speed up our application development in the future.    


Basically, these utilities npm packages can be devided into 3 categories:
* can work in both brower and nodejs environment        
* can only work in brower environment       
* can only work in nodejs environment
